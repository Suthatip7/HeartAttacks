# HeartAttacks
1. Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data :
  - Perform preliminary data inspection and report the findings as the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.
  - Based on the findings from the previous question, remove duplicates (if any) and treat missing values using an appropriate strategy.
  - Get a preliminary statistical summary of the data. Explore the measures of central tendencies and the spread of the data overall.

2. Performing EDA:
  - Identify the data variables which might be categorical in nature. Describe and explore these variables using appropriate tools. For example: count plot.
  - Study the occurrence of CVD across different ages.
  - Can we detect heart attack based on anomalies in resting blood pressure of the patient?
  - Study the composition of overall patients w.r.t . gender.

3. Performing EDA and Modeling:
  - Describe the relationship between cholesterol levels and our target variable.
  - What can be concluded about the relationship between peak exercising and occurrence of heart attack?
  - Is thalassemia a major cause of CVD? How are the other factors determining the occurrence of CVD?
  - Use a pair plot to understand the relationship between all the given variables.
  - Perform Adaboost, predict the outcome for test data, and validate the results by using the confusion matrix.
